# TRAmod-TRLmod
Load .drm files into TRA/TRL

To build TRAmod/TRAmod edit build_TRAmod.bat / build_TRLmod.bat respectively to work with your C++ compiler.
The dll file from DLL directory is universal and will work with both TRAmod.exe and TRAmod.exe, just rename it to TRAhook.dll / TRLhook.dll respectivly and place in the same directory as executable.

The .drm files will be loaded from "mods" subdirectory located in the same directory where both executable and dll reside.
